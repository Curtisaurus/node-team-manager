# node-team-manager
A node-based command-line-driven development team profile generator!

## Description
This commmand-line application prompts users for information about members of a development team starting with a manager.  The user can then add engineers and interns to the team profile.  Each employee will have prompt information concerning their employee ID and email information and a employee role-specific line of information.  After answering all prompts and selecting to finish building your team, the application will generate an html file styled to display each team member's information.  For engineers, their role-specific information is their GitHub username which will generate a link that navigates to their GitHub profile in a separate tab of your browser.
